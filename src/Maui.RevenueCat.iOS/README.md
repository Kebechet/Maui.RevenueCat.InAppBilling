## Versioning Scheme
The versioning scheme of `Maui.RevenueCat.iOS` is derived from the versioning of `revenuecat/purchases-ios`.

### Example:
| revenuecat/purchases-ios | Maui.RevenueCat.iOS | Note |
|:--|:--|:--|
| 3.4.1 | 3.4.1.0 | First version of bindings for 3.4.1 |
| 3.4.1 | 3.4.1.17 | Bindings for 3.4.1 containing fixes |

# Binding creation

## Porting old xamarin library ios to .NET MAUI
First version of our Maui binding was just changed `Xamarin.RevenueCat.iOS` binding working for .NET MAUI. It was binding around `RevenueCat ios 4.9.0`, but this native library contained bitcode which is no longer accepted by AppStore.
Porting of binding from Xamarin to Maui required several changes:
- Removed some attributes in `ApiDefinitions` - [commit](https://github.com/Kebechet/Maui.RevenueCat.iOS/commit/5796f045bf6d8c591f8c5bc2afbb9535abd97bda)
- Changed `IntPtr` -> `NativeReference` in `ApiDefinitions` - [commit](https://github.com/Kebechet/Maui.RevenueCat.iOS/commit/2adb01ce19f4423588cd1b87a290067fc25c3593)
	- [reference](https://blog.ostebaronen.dk/2023/04/net6.0-migration.html#6-change-intptr-to-nativehandle-on-ios)
- Added `NoBindingEmbedding = false` - [commit](https://github.com/Kebechet/Maui.RevenueCat.iOS/commit/d88e24a8c4f36f1774c42801b482f8276d286b53)

## Creating completely new binding consisted of these steps:
Because of a problem with bitcode I have decided to create completely new binding from scratch. Here are steps I have done:

### Generating binding files
- On my MAC I have downloaded and installed [Objective Sharpie](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/xamarin/cross-platform/macios/binding/objective-sharpie/)
- I have downloaded [RevenueCat.framework.zip](https://github.com/RevenueCat/purchases-ios/releases/tag/4.19.0) of `purchases-ios v4.19.0`
- I have extracted the `iOS` folder on my MAC desktop
- started terminal, then `cd ~/Desktop`
- firstly check what versions of xcode SDKs you have installed by `sharpie xcode -sdks` and use the `iphoneosXX.Y` version you have
- I used command `sharpie bind -framework iOS/RevenueCat.framework -sdk iphoneos16.4 -scope iOS/RevenueCat.framework/Headers`
  - this command generated `ApiDefinitions.cs` and `StructsAndEnums.cs` files
  - in case it did not and gives you error: `RevenueCat: framework requires SDK 'iphoneosXX.Y' which is not installed. You may need a newer Xcode.` In my case it was `iphoneos16.4`
	- if you have older Xcode then update it
	- if you have newest Xcode then you need to install older iOS SDKs
	  - go to [Apple developer web](https://developer.apple.com/download/all/) and download Xcode that contains that SDK. In my case `Xcode 14.3.1` contains `iphoneos16.4`
	  - after the download extract `.xip` file and after extraction right click on extracted Xcode file and `Show Package Contents`
	  - then navigate there into `/Applications/Xcode/Contents/Developer/Platforms/iPhoneOS.platform/Developer/SDKs` and copy `iPhoneOsXX.Y.sdk` (if it is just link/alias then copy the `iPhoneOs.sdk` and rename it to `iPhoneOsXX.Y.sdk` in my case `iPhoneOS16.4.sdk`)
	  - then go to location of your original Xcode -> `Show Package Contents` -> navigate again to: `/Applications/Xcode/Contents/Developer/Platforms/iPhoneOS.platform/Developer/SDKs` and paste the copied `iPhoneOSXX.Y.sdk` there
	  - restart Xcode
	  - to verify you did everything correctly run in terminal: `sharpie xcode -sdks` and the new SDK you copied should be now there as well
	  - then run the `sharpie` command to generate  `ApiDefinitions.cs` and `StructsAndEnums.cs` files again

### Adjusting generated files
- then I placed new framework file into repo
  - framework file - [commit](https://github.com/Kebechet/Maui.RevenueCat.iOS/commit/f03da2c2a98c0ae5cae5492a9f9974191aa880d8)
  - generated files - [commit](https://github.com/Kebechet/Maui.RevenueCat.iOS/commit/761d75b3fe01309a54fde1c5a1382d357e2b11d2)
- firstly commented but later completely removed `Verify` attributes - [commit](https://github.com/Kebechet/Maui.RevenueCat.iOS/commit/471e867dccf15124e81bcd9d1943f6599563629f)
- then removed all device-specific attributes - [commit](https://github.com/Kebechet/Maui.RevenueCat.iOS/commit/5aa004565614ba65d19ef3d96724e015f1584b44)
  - TIP: You can find all attributes by searching for `iOS (`. Because all of them contain this string
  - at the same time commented out ` (AutoGeneratedName = true)` 
- added namespaces - [commit](https://github.com/Kebechet/Maui.RevenueCat.iOS/commit/09b545fc5f0f9bf2da8e328aa3b9757d7ed1f3c5)
- comment out text that was not commented out - [commit](https://github.com/Kebechet/Maui.RevenueCat.iOS/commit/bd79684d44e15f46cdd5225678e7bc52bfc746da)
- then I merged interfaces with the same names e.g. `RCAttribution` and `RCAttribution_RevenueCat_Swift_3714` I put together - [commit](https://github.com/Kebechet/Maui.RevenueCat.iOS/commit/43c996de81c8270b9783eadeea09ed557d6f8901)
  - I have also removed obsolete & deprecated interfaces/methods 
- removed default using there were useless - [commit](https://github.com/Kebechet/Maui.RevenueCat.iOS/commit/459fc5d4bf09a4dfaaa6122c841a307f54779915)
- removed constants interface - [commit](https://github.com/Kebechet/Maui.RevenueCat.iOS/commit/f794248fa9a524e83471526b5517d9f1046b8f04)
  - because I didnt know how to bind `byte[]` üòÖ
  - (optional) If you would like to bind the `RevenueCatVersionNumber` use this for interface name: `[BaseType(typeof(NSObject))] [DisableDefaultCtor] interface RCConstants` and above the variable put `[Static]` attribute
- removed interfaces without methods/properties - [commit](https://github.com/Kebechet/Maui.RevenueCat.iOS/commit/221c593836f6e5dd956466cafe7603585b73b932)
- remove Protocols that were used for inheritance - [commit](https://github.com/Kebechet/Maui.RevenueCat.iOS/commit/b614289e0dbc4edefb4c6c7e024ae1586a6ebf83)
- removed delegate that was not used anywhere - [commit](https://github.com/Kebechet/Maui.RevenueCat.iOS/commit/d408d99423226391f7b37f73791bad7fc4772326)
- added `INativeObject` inheritance for interfaces that were used in dictionaries and was of type `NSObject` - [commit](https://github.com/Kebechet/Maui.RevenueCat.iOS/commit/ea45d9555946887aa814fb470af45f616c89785d)
- replaced `NSUrlRequest` for `NSMutableUrlRequest` - [commit](https://github.com/Kebechet/Maui.RevenueCat.iOS/commit/df1bb5ef23fa7176f3cc4f2b6a4778dea7baa53b)
- created delegates for Purchases - [commit](https://github.com/Kebechet/Maui.RevenueCat.iOS/commit/464d0e3028fea089bdb133bc8575381087f9d294)
- removed inherited `NSObject` methods - [commit](https://github.com/Kebechet/Maui.RevenueCat.iOS/commit/5fd366f5eb58903b1788a3781a9f6d00a470f681)
  - `isEqual` and `Description` 
  - also removed `DebugDescription` - [commit](https://github.com/Kebechet/Maui.RevenueCat.iOS/commit/d3741f1ce23b4b46e1a0184b03baafd1ff715201)
- removed inherited `NSOperation` methods - [commit](https://github.com/Kebechet/Maui.RevenueCat.iOS/commit/1033aaca86e60519ea4b75ed3fe6d65ea3e456c4)
- I have created aliases for methods named the same - [commit](https://github.com/Kebechet/Maui.RevenueCat.iOS/commit/866a0fbbff26b942307c77dd54bd14ac81de572b)
  - ‚ö†Ô∏è I dont know if this is correct or even necessary, maybe I could delete them as well
- removed attributes containing `Name` - [commit](https://github.com/Kebechet/Maui.RevenueCat.iOS/commit/4aa727562d17829c742dcd6c2f51ba3c3cb836ff)
  - this was because on my windows machine I was getting errors that platform doesnt have symbols specified for this methods containing the name
  - later I completely removed those methods because the error was still there - [commit](https://github.com/Kebechet/Maui.RevenueCat.iOS/commit/3fcceeb6ff9d8207a3545f89ddf28639cb3c0f79)
- from `.xcframework` remove all `*.swiftmodule` directories
- ‚úÖ - Done 
  - I have tested this new binding in the simulator as well as on real device through TestFlight and it works as expected
## Additional fix:
  - if you experience build error: `lang++ exited with code 1: error : Undefined symbols for architecture arm64`
    - I experienced this problem while debugging on Remote device (iphone connected directly to MAC and that MAC connected to Windows)

  ```
  - then remove those types e.g. `FakeASIdManager` from `ApiDefinitions.cs` file - [commit](https://github.com/Kebechet/Maui.RevenueCat.iOS/commit/4aa727562d17829c742dcd6c2f51ba3c3cb836ff)

## Xcode
- When latest Xcode version is out it doesn't mean MAUI/Xamarin can immediately it.
  - You can find [here](https://github.com/xamarin/xamarin-macios/wiki) what Xcode is currently supported. Even though Xcode version is on the list make sure to check open github issues in the [xamarin-macios](https://github.com/xamarin/xamarin-macios) repo
  - In case you want to upgrade/downgrade to specific Xcode version then:
    - uninstall your current version
    - download version you want: https://developer.apple.com/download/all/
    - extract `.xip` file and move it's content to `/Applications` folder
    - after extraction open Xcode and it will ask you to install additional components (e.g. iOS) so install it
- In case you get error `The connection cannot continue because the remote iOS SDK was not found or is corrupted.`
  - go to your MAC and in terminal do: `rm -rf ~/Library/Caches/Xamarin/XMA/SDKs/dotnet/`

## ‚ö†Ô∏è**Warning**
- in `.NET 7` and with `VS2022` `v17.7` IT IS NOT POSSIBLE TO BUILD THE PACKAGE WITH EMBEDDED NATIVE LIBRARY (even with connected MAC).
  - You need to build this package on MAC with VS for MAC. Only that way it will link native library to the package.
  - https://github.com/dotnet/maui/issues/14982
- in `VS2022` `v17.8.4` with latest `MAUI` it works correctly
